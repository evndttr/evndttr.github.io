As a Univeristy Administrative Fellow at Princeton University Library (PUL), I collaborated with librarians and faculty to help curate a collection of historical materials related to [Indigenous Studies](https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures) and items related to the [Lunaapeewak (Lenape or Delaware people)](https://dpul.princeton.edu/lenape) on whose ancestral lands sits the campus of Princeton University. These exhibits were curated in Princetonâ€™s Digital Library (DPUL) curatorial interface, an tool based on "Spotlight" a plugin of the Blacklight discovery interface. Also at PUL, I helped create an [Advanced Searching Techniques](https://libguides.princeton.edu/advancedsearch) Libguide.
